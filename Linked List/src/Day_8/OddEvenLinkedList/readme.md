# ðŸ§  328. Odd Even Linked List

## ðŸ’¬ Problem Statement

Given the **head of a singly linked list**, group all the nodes with **odd indices together**, followed by the nodes with **even indices**, and return the reordered list.

- The **first node** is considered **odd**, the second is **even**, and so on.
- **Maintain the original relative order** inside the odd and even groups.
- The solution must run in **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space.

## âœ¨ Example 1

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,3,5,2,4]


## âœ¨ Example 2

Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
