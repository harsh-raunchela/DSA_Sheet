        ## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

You are given a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** with `n` nodes and a target value `x`. Your task is to find the **greatest value node in the BST which is smaller than or equal to `x`**.

        > ðŸ“Œ Note: If `x` is smaller than the smallest node in the BST, return `-1`.

        ---

        ## ðŸ“¥ Input Format

- An integer `n` representing the number of nodes in the BST.
  - The structure of the BST.
- An integer `x` whose floor value is to be found.

---

        ## ðŸ“¤ Output Format

- Return a single integer â€” the floor of `x` in the BST.

        ## ðŸ’¡ Examples

### Example 1:
Input:
n = 7
BST Structure:
2

        81
        /
        42 87
        \
        66 90
        /
        45

x = 87

Output:
87

yaml
Copy code
**Explanation**: 87 exists in the tree, so the floor is 87.

        ### Example 2:
Input:
n = 4
BST Structure:
6

        8
        /
        7 9

x = 11

Output:
9

yaml
Copy code
**Explanation**: No node with value 11, but the largest value â‰¤ 11 is 9.

        ### Example 3:
Input:
n = 4
BST Structure:
6

        8
        /
        7 9

x = 5

Output:
-1

yaml
Copy code
**Explanation**: All nodes in the BST are greater than 5.

        ## âœ… Constraints

- `1 <= Node data <= 10^9`
  - `1 <= n <= 10^5`
