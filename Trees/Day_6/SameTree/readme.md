## 🚀 Problem Statement

Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are **the same** or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are **structurally identical** and the **nodes have the same value**.

## 🧠 Example

### ✅ Example 1:
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true


### ❌ Example 2:
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false


### ❌ Example 3:
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
