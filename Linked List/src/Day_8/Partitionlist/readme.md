## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

Given the `head` of a singly linked list and an integer `x`, partition it such that **all nodes with values less than `x` come before nodes with values greater than or equal to `x`**.

You must **preserve the original relative order** of the nodes in each of the two partitions.
