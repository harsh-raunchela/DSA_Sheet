## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

You're given a **multilevel doubly linked list**. Each node contains:

- `val`: an integer
- `prev`: pointer to the previous node
- `next`: pointer to the next node
- `child`: pointer to a **child doubly linked list**, which may have its own children

Your task is to **flatten** this structure into a **single-level doubly linked list**, such that:

- All nodes appear in a linear order
- Each `child` list is inserted **immediately after its parent node**, before the original `next`
- All `child` pointers in the final list must be `null`

---

## ðŸ“¥ Input Format

The linked list is serialized as an array where `null` values separate child levels. For example:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]

## ðŸ“¤ Output Format

A flattened version of the list where all `child` lists are recursively inserted between the parent node and its next.
