# üîÅ Circular Queue (Ring Buffer) ‚Äì LeetCode Problem #22

## üöÄ Overview

This project is a custom implementation of a **Circular Queue**, also known as a **Ring Buffer**. It's a linear data structure that wraps around ‚Äî making use of empty slots efficiently through a circular approach. All operations follow the **FIFO** (First In, First Out) principle.

A circular queue solves a key limitation of regular queues: in a normal queue, once it's full, we can't insert more even if there‚Äôs space in front (due to deletions). Circular queues fix that ‚Äî making them super useful in systems like task schedulers, streaming buffers, and OS-level job queues.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

Here‚Äôs what this queue can do:

- `MyCircularQueue(k)`: Initializes the queue with size `k`.
- `enQueue(value)`: Adds a value to the rear. Returns `true` if successful.
- `deQueue()`: Removes a value from the front. Returns `true` if successful.
- `Front()`: Returns the front element or `-1` if the queue is empty.
- `Rear()`: Returns the last element or `-1` if the queue is empty.
- `isEmpty()`: Checks if the queue is empty.
- `isFull()`: Checks if the queue is full.

No built-in queue classes are used ‚Äî it‚Äôs all coded from scratch üí™.

### Regular Queue vs Circular Queue
| Feature          | Regular Queue       | Circular Queue       |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Fixed size?      | Yes                 | Yes                   |
| Reuse space?     | ‚ùå No               | ‚úÖ Yes                |
| Efficient memory | ‚ùå Often wasted     | ‚úÖ Fully utilized     |

## üß™ Example Walkthrough

```js
Input:
["MyCircularQueue", "enQueue", "enQueue", "enQueue", "enQueue", "Rear", "isFull", "deQueue", "enQueue", "Rear"]
[[3], [1], [2], [3], [4], [], [], [], [4], []]

Output:
[null, true, true, true, false, 3, true, true, true, 4]
