## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return its **vertical order traversal**.

Each node in the tree is assigned a position based on the rules:

- The root is at position `(0, 0)`
- The left child of a node at `(r, c)` is at `(r + 1, c - 1)`
- The right child is at `(r + 1, c + 1)`

The vertical order traversal requires:
- Sorting columns from left to right
- Sorting nodes within each column from top to bottom
- Sorting by node values if multiple nodes share the same position
