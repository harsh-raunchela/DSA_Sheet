# 🌲 LeetCode 543: Diameter of Binary Tree

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the **length of the diameter** of the tree.

The **diameter** is defined as the **longest path between any two nodes** in the tree. This path **doesn't have to go through the root**, and the length is measured in **number of edges** between nodes.

## 📸 Examples

### Example 1:
Input: root = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 3
Explanation: Longest paths → [4, 2, 1, 3] or [5, 2, 1, 3]



### Example 2:
Input: root = [1, 2]
Output: 1
