## ğŸ§© Problem Statement

A parentheses string is **valid** if and only if:

1. It is the empty string `""`.
2. It can be written as `AB`, where `A` and `B` are valid strings.
3. It can be written as `(A)`, where `A` is a valid string.

You're given a string `s` containing only `'('` and `')'`.

ğŸ›  **In one move**, you can insert a parenthesis at any position in the string.

ğŸ‘‰ Your task is to return the **minimum number of insertions** needed to make `s` valid.
