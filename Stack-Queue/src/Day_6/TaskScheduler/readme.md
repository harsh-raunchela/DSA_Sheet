## ðŸ“„ Problem Statement

You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by a capital letter from `'A'` to `'Z'`, and a non-negative integer `n` representing the **cooldown interval**.

Each task takes exactly **1 interval** to complete.  
A **cooldown of `n`** means you can't execute the same task again until at least `n` intervals have passed.

Return the **minimum number of CPU intervals** required to complete all the tasks, including idle intervals if necessary.
