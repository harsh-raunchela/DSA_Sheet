## ðŸ§  Problem Summary

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return **all** root-to-leaf paths in **any order**.

> **Leaf** = a node that has no children.

---

## ðŸ“¥ Input

- A binary tree represented as a list.
- Example:  
  `root = [1,2,3,null,5]`

---

## ðŸ“¤ Output

- A list of strings, each string is a root-to-leaf path joined by `"->"`.

---

## ðŸ“¸ Examples

### Example 1

Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5]


1
/ \
2   3
\
5
Output: ["1->2->5", "1->3"]



### Example 2

Input: root = [1]

Output: ["1"]
