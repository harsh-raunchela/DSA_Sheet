# 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree (Hard)

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored or transmitted and reconstructed later.

Design an algorithm to **serialize** and **deserialize** a binary tree.

> âœ… Your algorithm **does not need to follow LeetCode's format**, as long as it can serialize and then deserialize back to the same tree.

## ðŸ§ª Example 1

Input:
root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]

Output:
[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
